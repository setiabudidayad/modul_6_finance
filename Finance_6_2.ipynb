Clear Lake\n","Sporting Goods is a small merchandising company (a company that buys finished goods and sells them to\n","consumers) that sells hunting and fishing gear.

Note that the comparative income statements and To begin an analysis of receivables, it’s important to first understand the cycles and periods used in the calculations.\n","</center>\n","\n","## **Operating Cycle**\n","A period is one operating cycle of a business. The operating cycle includes the cash conversion cycle plus the accounts receivable cycle (discussed below). Essentially it is the time it takes a business to purchase or make inventory and then sell it. For example, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods orders and receives a shipment of fishing lures on June 1. It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the lures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\n","\n","### **Cash Conversion Cycle**\n","Cash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\n","conversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then collect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June 1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an open account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its account. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\n","\n","Let’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash conversion cycle.\n","\n","### **Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio**\n","Receivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers), as well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable turnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected during a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly. This quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the company may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value of money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension terms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers means that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\n","\n","In contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\n","collection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending opportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows that the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other current projects. The lower turnover rate may signal a high level of bad debt accounts. The determination of a high or low turnover rate really depends on the standards of the company’s industry. It’s key to note the tradeoff in adjusting credit terms. Loose credit terms may attract more customers but may also increase bad\n","debt expense. Tighter credit terms may attract fewer customers but may also reduce bad debt expense.\n","\n","The formula for accounts receivable turnover is\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Accounts Receivable Turnover}=\\frac{\\text{Net Credit Sales}}{\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}}\n","$$\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Accounts Receivable Receivable}=\\frac{\\text{Beginning Accounts Receivable + Ending Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{2}}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"M4mszJo43i3C"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Net credit sales are sales made on credit only; cash sales are not included because they do not produce\n","receivables. However, many companies do not report credit sales separately from cash sales, so “net sales” may be substituted for “net credit sales” in this case. Beginning and ending accounts receivable refer to the beginning and ending balances in accounts receivable for the period. The beginning accounts receivable balance is the same figure as the ending accounts receivable balance from the prior period.\n","\n","When computing the accounts receivable turnover for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, let’s assume net credit sales make up $\\$100,000$ of the $\\$120,000$ of the net sales found on the income statement in the current year.\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Average Accounts Receivable}= \\frac{\\text{\\$20,000 + \\$30,000}}{2} = \\$25,000\n","$$\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Average Accounts Turnover}= \\frac{\\text{\\$100,000}}{\\$25,000} = 4 \\;\\;\\text{times} $$\n","\n","To gain a better understanding of its ratio performance, Clear Lake Sporting Goods can compare its turnover to industry averages, key competitors, and its own historical ratios.

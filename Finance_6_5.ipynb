Both the balance sheet and income statement are needed to calculate earnings per share. The balance sheet provides details on the preferred dividend rate, the total par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common shares outstanding. The income statement indicates the net income for the period. The formula to calculate basic\n","earnings per share is\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Earnings per Share} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income - Preferred Dividends}} {\\text{Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding}}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","By removing the preferred dividends from net income, the numerator represents the profit available to common shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the amount of net income to be distributed to preferred shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not available for common shareholders. While a number of variations of measuring a company’s profit, such as NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), are used in the financial world, GAAP\n","requires companies to calculate earnings per share based on a corporation’s net income, as this amount appears directly on a company’s income statement, which for public companies must be audited.\n","\n","In the denominator, only common shares are used to determine earnings per share because earnings per share is a measure of earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator can fluctuate throughout the year as a company issues and buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average number of shares is used on the denominator because of this fluctuation. To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the year with 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period January 1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares outstanding. Once the new shares were issued, the company had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of 1,600 shares for each of the next nine months—from April 1 to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares, apply these\n","fractional weights to both of the stock amounts (see Figure 6.6).\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/setiabudidayad/modul_6_finance/raw/main/Gambar_6_6.png\">\n","\n","**Figure 6.6** Weighted Shares\n","</center>\n","\n","If the shares were not weighted, the calculation would not consider the time period during which the shares were outstanding.\n","\n","To illustrate how earnings per share is calculated, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods earns $\\$35,000$ in net income during the current year. During the year, the company also declared a $\\$5,000$ dividend on preferred stock and a $\\$6,000$ dividend on common stock. The company had 8,000 common shares outstanding the entire year. Clear Lake Sporting Goods has generated $\\$3.75$ of earnings ($\\$35,000$ less the $\\$5,000$ of preferred dividends) for each of the 8,000 common shares of stock it has outstanding.\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Earnings per Share} = \\frac{\\text{\\$35,000 - \\$5,000}}{8,000} = \\$3.75\n","$$\n","\n","\n","### **Measuring Performance with Earnings per Share**\n","Earnings per share is a key profitability measure that both current and potential common stockholders monitor. Its importance is accentuated by the fact that GAAP requires public companies to report earnings per share on the face of a company’s income statement. This is the only ratio that requires such prominent\n","reporting. If fact, public companies are required to report two different earnings per share amounts on their income statements—basic and diluted. We’ve illustrated the calculation of basic earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share, which is not demonstrated here, involves the consideration of all securities, such as stocks and bonds, that could potentially dilute, or reduce, the basic earnings per share.\n","\n","## **Link To Learning**\n","## Finding Earning per Share for Public Companies\n","\n","Where can you find earnings per share information on public companies?

Investors realize that inadequate earnings per share can result in poor or inconsistent dividend payments and fluctuating stock prices. As such, companies seek to produce earnings per share amounts that rise each period. However, an increase in earnings per share may not always reflect favorable performance, as there are multiple reasons that earnings per share may increase. One way earnings per share can increase is through increased net income. On the other hand, it can also increase when a company buys back its own shares of stock.\n","\n","For example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods generated net income of $\\$30,000$ and paid out $\\$3,000$ in preferred shareholder dividends last year. In addition, 10,550 shares of common stock were outstanding throughout the entire year.

It’s key to note the impact of purchasing treasury stock and the intentions in doing so.
